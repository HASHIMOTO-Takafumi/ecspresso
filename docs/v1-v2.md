# Differences of ecspresso v1 and v2.

See also [#374](https://github.com/kayac/ecspresso/issues/374).

## Breaking changes

- Abolish `create` command. `deploy` command can create a service.
- `rollback --deregister-task-definition` true by default.
- `render` command accepts args instead of flags.
- `verify` command doesn't roll back IAM role to executionRole.
- `diff --unified` true by default.
- Outputs of log messages never refresh the terminal and break lines. These messages flow simply.

## Enhanced

- A configuration file accepts Jsonnet format. `init --jsonnet` is also supported.
- Show the progress bar during deployment on CodeDeploy.
- `verify` verfies container image platform.

## Others

- Switch AWS SDK Go v2 from v1.
- Switch CLI parser to [kong](https://github.com/alecthomas/kong) from [kingpin](https://github.com/alecthomas/kingpin).
- Use [ecsta](https://github.com/fujiwara/ecsta) as library to manipulate ECS tasks.
